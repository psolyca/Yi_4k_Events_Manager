# Yi_4k_Events_Manager

This repository stores various scripts used with the event manager for the custom firmware of the [Yi4k](https://github.com/psolyca/Yi_4k_ROOTFS/releases).

Each script is used for one specific action but they can have multiple files to realize this action.

To use a script, just copy files in the archive in a folder named "events" in the root of your SDcard.

You can create you own script and propose it as a PR.
